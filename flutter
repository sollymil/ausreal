After having looked at various frameworks and languages, it would appear that Google Flutter, firebase.google.com and firebase.flutter.dev is a good place to start.

If you'd like to investigate flutter, you can start at flutter.dev

I'll be posting some basic Flutter code which you may find useful to start ausreal.net development, particularly, the 'Meritocracy' processes.

I really look forward to you joining this team.

ausreal can be implemented Worldwide, a government by the People, for the People.

Love and peace,
